#Step 1: Create a directory for your dataset
#in this case, our directory is Reservoirs/Data/DataAlreadyUploadedToEDI/EDIProductionFiles/MakeEML_Ice

#Step 2: Move your dataset to the directory

#Step 3: Create an intellectual rights license
#ours is CCBY

#Step 4: Identify the types of data in your dataset
#right now the only supported option is "table"

#Step 5: Import the core metadata templates
import_templates(path = "/Users/cayelan/Dropbox/ComputerFiles/Virginia_Tech/FallingCreek/Github/Reservoirs/Data/DataAlreadyUploadedToEDI/EDIProductionFiles/MakeEMLIce",
                 license = "CCBY",
                 data.files = c("Ice_Data_2013_2022updated.csv"))

# Edit each of these files for your current data package upload, by copying and 
# pasting the relevant information from the EDI_metadata_template you prepared

# Important! Before saving, check that the contents of each .txt file do not include any 
# non-allowed characters by going to: https://pteo.paranoiaworks.mobi/diacriticsremover/, 
# pasting your text, and clicking remove diacritics. copy and paste that text back into the .txt file.

view_unit_dictionary()

# After saving each file, make sure it is closed.

#Step 6: Script your workflow
#that's what this is, silly!

#Step 7: Abstract
#copy-paste the abstract from your Microsoft Word document into abstract.txt
#if you want to check your abstract for non-allowed characters, go to:
#https://pteo.paranoiaworks.mobi/diacriticsremover/
#paste text and click remove diacritics

#Step 8: Methods
#copy-paste the methods from your Microsoft Word document into abstract.txt
#if you want to check your abstract for non-allowed characters, go to:
#https://pteo.paranoiaworks.mobi/diacriticsremover/
#paste text and click remove diacritics

#Step 9: Additional information
#nothing mandatory for Carey Lab in this section

#Step 10: Keywords
#DO NOT EDIT KEYWORDS FILE USING A TEXT EDITOR!! USE EXCEL!!
#see the LabKeywords.txt file for keywords that are mandatory for all Carey Lab data products

#Step 11: Personnel
#copy-paste this information in from your metadata document
#Cayelan needs to be listed several times; she has to be listed separately for her roles as
#PI, creator, and contact, and also separately for each separate funding source (!!)

#Step 12: Attributes
#grab attribute names and definitions from your metadata word document
#for units....
# View and search the standard units dictionary
#view_unit_dictionary()
#put flag codes and site codes in the definitions cell
#force reservoir to categorical

#Step 13: Close files
#if all your files aren't closed, sometimes functions don't work

#Step 14: Categorical variables
# View documentation for this function
#?define_catvars

# Run this function for your dataset
define_catvars(path = "/Users/cayelan/Dropbox/ComputerFiles/Virginia_Tech/FallingCreek/Github/Reservoirs/Data/DataAlreadyUploadedToEDI/EDIProductionFiles/MakeEMLIce")

#open the created value IN A SPREADSHEET EDITOR and add a definition for each category

#Step 15: Geographic coverage
#copy-paste the bounding_boxes.txt file that is Carey Lab specific into your working directory

#Step 16: Make EML
# View documentation for this function
?make_eml

## Step XXX: Obtain a package.id. ####
# Go to the EDI staging environment (https://portal-s.edirepository.org/nis/home.jsp),
# then login using one of the Carey Lab usernames and passwords. 

# Select Tools --> Data Package Identifier Reservations and click 
# "Reserve Next Available Identifier"
# A new value will appear in the "Current data package identifier reservations" 
# table (e.g., edi.123)
# Make note of this value, as it will be your package.id below

## Step XXX: Make EML metadata file using the EMLassemblyline::make_eml() command ####
# For modules that contain only zip folders, modify and run the following 
# ** double-check that all files are closed before running this command! **

# You will need to modify the following lines to match your current module: 
# path: set to your computer's FULL file path!
# dataset.title: Update to current module
# zip.dir: Change the name of the module files zip folder
# temporal.coverage: Update the dates
# package.id: enter the ID you obtained in Step 6

# Once your xml file with your PUBLISHED package.id is Done, return to the 
# EDI Production environment (https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/home.jsp)

# Select Tools --> Preview Your Metadata, then upload your metadata (.xml) file 
# associated with your PUBLISHED package.id. Look through the rendered 
# metadata one more time to check for mistakes (author order, bounding box, etc.)

# Select Tools --> Evaluate/Upload Data Packages, then under "EML Metadata File", 
# choose your metadata (.xml) file associated with your PUBLISHED package.id 
# (e.g., edi.518.1.xml), check "I want to manually upload the data by selecting 
# files on my local system", then click Upload.

# Now, Choose File for each file within the data package (e.g., each zip folder), 
# then click Upload. Files will upload and your EML metadata will be checked for 
# errors. Since you checked for and fixed errors in the staging environment, this 
# should run without errors, and your data product is now published! 

# Click the package.id hyperlink to view your final product! HOORAY!
